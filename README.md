## Persons

Persons is a contact listing application. This is my first SwiftUI application. So I developed this app right after I learned Swift and SwiftUI basics.

- While developing this project, I learned how to send a request to a web service with Alamofire.
- I experienced the View - ViewModel structure.

**Note:** With this project, there are not many features and views as I aim to learn communication with API. My next projects will be bigger :)
